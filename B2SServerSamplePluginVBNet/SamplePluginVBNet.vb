''' Main class of the B2S.Server plugin.<br/>
''' This class must implement the IDirectPlugin interface provided by the B2SServerPluginInterface.dll.<br/>
''' If a plugin provides a frontend the IDirectPluginFrontend interface has to be implemented as well.<br/>
''' <br/>
''' In addition to the implementation of the necessary interfaces, the class has to be exported for the use with MEF using the following attribute  [Export(typeof(B2S.IDirectPlugin))] (for VB.net &lt;Export(GetType(B2S.IDirectPlugin))&gt; would be the same).
''' /remark Remember to change the name of the class to something meaningful for your plugin project when reusing this code.
