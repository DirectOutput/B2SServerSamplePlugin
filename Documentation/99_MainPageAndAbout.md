The B2S.Server has been implemented by Stefan/<a href="http://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showuser=57523">Herweh</a>. He has been kind enough to add a plugin infrasturucture to the B2S.Server, so other libraries can listen to the dataflow of Pinmame as well.

B2S.Server Sample Plugin Documentation
======================================

This project contains 2 sample plugins (C# and VB.net) for the B2S.Server. Please use them (the source code is fully documented) to learn how to implement your own plugins.

The documentation contains only pages on the C# version of the sample plugin, but both plugins are implementing the same functionality and have the same comments and documentation.
